## My Study 

* Day 0: 2021-03-30: discovered a link to this course, signed up, and forked the repo. Watched the first video, which outlined the Flexbox course of study. The videos and repo (fork) are easily to follow along with, while learning. 
* Day 1: 2021-03-31: [Introduction to Flexbox](https://github.com/EO4wellness/What-The-Flexbox/tree/eo4wellness/intro)
   - Today we start with a basic HTML and CSS template, of sorts. 
 
            <code> display: flex; </code>
            
   - This is where we start.  this establishes our container with its content. 
   - if we add a border say [code--> border:10px solid goldenrod;] as in our template, will add a border around our flex content so we can better visualize what a flex container is and where its edges lay on our page. 
   - another code evariation is 

                  <code> display: inline-flex; </code>
     which wraps around the content, only taking up the width that it needs. without the "inline" portion this code goes all the way across 
   - the divs on the page are children of the flex container as soon as we have the display flex code on the page. 
   - tomorrow, we look at axis and flex direction.  as a set up for tomorrow we going to add height.  
   - in real life, the height would come from the actual content 
   - we added 

                      <code> height: 100vh; </code>
   - V H is the code for viewport height.  it makes the container stretch the entire height which is available.  it is like height 100% 
   - Review: ON the HTML code, we have our FLEX container and our FLEX items (box 1-10)
